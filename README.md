# Front Matter Button Plugin

This plugin provides a button that appears and hides on hover of a note title to allow users to easily add the frontmatter section to the top of their note. This is a beta plugin so it is not able to be added from the community plugins page. In order to install and stay up to date with this plugin, you can use [TfTHacker's BRAT Plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) to add the Frontmatter button to your notes.

This plugin also has a setting that was a work in progress on displaying and adding front matter in a more user friendly way. This feature will probably be abandoned given the Obsidian Properties update that is due to come out. We will continue to work on the button to allow users to show and hide file properties once that update goes live in Obsidian
